Abstract

   Health-care–related transportation insecurity is common in the
   United States. Patients with cancer are especially vulnerable
   because cancer care is episodic in nature, occurs over a
   prolonged period, is marked by frequent clinical encounters,
   requires intense treatments, and results in substantial
   financial hardship. As a result of transportation insecurity,
   patients with cancer may forego, miss, delay, alter, and/or
   prematurely terminate necessary care. Limited data suggest that
   these alterations in care have the potential to increase the
   rates of cancer recurrence and mortality and exacerbate
   disparities in cancer incidence, severity, and outcomes.
   Transportation insecurity also negatively impacts at the
   informal caregiver, provider, health system, and societal
   levels. Recognizing that transportation is a critical
   determinant of outcomes for patients with cancer, there are
   ongoing efforts to develop evidence-based protocols to identify
   at-risk patients and address transportation insecurity at
   federal policy, health system, not-for-profit, and industry
   levels. In 2021, the National Cancer Policy Forum of the
   National Academies of Science, Engineering, and Medicine
   sponsored a series of webinars addressing key social
   determinants of health including food, housing, and
   transportation among patients with cancer. This commentary
   summarizes the formal presentations and discussions related to
   transportation insecurity and will 1) discuss the heterogeneous
   nature of transportation insecurity among patients with cancer;
   2) characterize its prevalence along the cancer continuum; 3)
   examine its multilevel consequences; 4) discuss measurement and
   screening tools; 5) highlight ongoing efforts to address
   transportation insecurity; 6) suggest policy levers; and 7)
   outline a research agenda to address critical knowledge gaps.

   Dorothy Baily (name changed to protect her privacy) is a
   71-year-old woman with emphysema and lung cancer requiring
   continuous oxygen. She would need to walk 5 blocks to take a
   bus to her oncologist’s office. Although this may seem like a
   short distance for a person in good health, 5 blocks is too far
   for Dorothy to feel comfortable walking because of her poor
   performance status and her need to carry her supplemental
   oxygen equipment. She relies on her grandson, the only person
   in the family with a car, to drive her for chemotherapy
   infusions. The grandson is a single parent working 2 part-time
   jobs; he is not eligible for unpaid leave benefits to care for
   his grandmother. Although he rescheduled his work to take his
   grandmother for chemotherapy, Ms Baily would occasionally miss
   her infusions when her grandson was too tired to drive to and
   from the infusion center. However, she was too embarrassed to
   tell her oncologist about her transportation insecurity.

   Health-care–related transportation insecurity is a condition in
   which one is unable to regularly move from place to place in a
   safe and timely manner because of the lack of material,
   economic, or social resources necessary for transportation to
   maintain health ([138]1,[139]2). In the United States,
   transportation insecurity was estimated to effect 5.8 million
   people in 2017 ([140]3) and disproportionately burdens racial
   and ethnic minority, low-income, elderly, and rural populations
   ([141]1,[142]4,[143]5). Transportation insecurity is a
   particularly important problem for patients with cancer for a
   number of reasons. First, patients with cancer are particularly
   susceptible to transportation as a barrier to medical care,
   with higher rates of transportation insecurity relative to
   similar patients without a history of cancer ([144]6,[145]7).
   Second, transportation insecurity among patients with cancer is
   common. Although the precise prevalence of transportation
   insecurity among patients with cancer is unknown
   ([146]6,[147]8,[148]9), according to the National Breast and
   Cervical Cancer Early Detection Program, up to 90% of women
   receiving assistance self-report lack of transportation as a
   barrier to screening ([149]10). Third, the consequences of
   transportation insecurity among patients with cancer are
   substantial. Transportation insecurity may result in patients
   with cancer foregoing, missing, delaying, and/or altering
   necessary clinical care ([150]4). Limited data suggest that
   transportation insecurity may be associated with oncologic
   outcomes ([151]7). However, extrapolating from other studies
   evaluating treatment delays and nonadherence among patients
   with cancer, it is recognized that transportation insecurity
   has the potential to increase the rates of cancer recurrence
   and mortality as well as exacerbate disparities in cancer
   incidence, severity, and outcomes ([152]11,[153]12).

   During 2021, the National Cancer Policy Forum of the National
   Academies of Science Engineering and Medicine sponsored a
   series of webinars addressing key social determinants of health
   including food, housing, and transportation insecurity among
   patients with cancer. These webinars summarized research
   evidence for the association of social determinants of health
   and disparities in cancer care and patient outcomes and
   identified promising interventions and opportunities for
   practice and policy to improve health equity. This commentary
   summarizes the formal presentations and webinar discussion
   related to transportation insecurity ([154]13) and will 1)
   discuss the heterogeneous nature of transportation insecurity
   among patients with cancer; 2) characterize its prevalence
   along the cancer care continuum; 3) examine its multilevel
   consequences; 4) discuss measurement and screening tools; 5)
   highlight ongoing efforts to address transportation insecurity;
   6) suggest policy levers; and 7) outline a research agenda to
   address critical knowledge gaps.

Multifaceted Nature of Transportation Insecurity Among Patients With Cancer

   Transportation insecurity among patients with cancer results
   from a diverse array of barriers. For example, transportation
   insecurity may arise from the inability to pay for gas,
   parking, public transit, or temporary lodging near specialty
   centers; insufficient public transportation infrastructure;
   lack of access to a vehicle; lack of an informal caregiver able
   to drive to and from clinical encounters; or the physical
   inability to travel long distances ([155]4,[156]14-16).
   Transportation insecurity is also a state, not a trait. Whereas
   some patients have long-term, consistent challenges accessing
   adequate transportation to and from cancer care facilities,
   others have unpredictable access to transportation because of
   unstable incomes, public transportation choices that are prone
   to disruptions, or personal vehicles that are unreliable
   ([157]6). As the COVID-19 pandemic reinforced,
   transportation-related barriers may arise as the external
   environment changes. Patients with cancer who previously relied
   on public transportation were suddenly unable to use this
   method because of concerns about its safety, and others were
   left with new transportation barriers when previously
   established methods were temporarily suspended (eg, American
   Cancer Society Road to Recovery). This dynamic and
   time-dependent nature of transportation insecurity is critical
   for patients with cancer who require available and affordable
   transportation for optimal prevention, screening, diagnosis,
   treatment initiation, completion of cancer-directed therapy,
   palliation, and survivorship care ([158]2,[159]7).
   Transportation insecurity is also context specific. Barriers to
   transportation among urban populations (eg, access to public
   transportation, neighborhood safety) may be quite different
   from barriers among rural populations (eg, travel distance)
   ([160]4,[161]17). Finally, transportation insecurity often
   doesn’t exist in isolation but rather is intermixed with other
   social needs including inadequate social support, financial
   toxicity, food insecurity, and housing insecurity
   ([162]9,[163]18,[164]19).

Prevalence of Transportation Insecurity Among Patients With Cancer

   Patients with cancer are particularly susceptible to
   transportation as a barrier to medical care. As shown in
   [165]Table 1, there are a number of factors that result in
   patients with cancer being an especially vulnerable population
   for transportation insecurity. These potential considerations
   have been validated empirically, as a number of studies have
   demonstrated higher rates of transportation insecurity among
   patients with cancer relative to those without a history of
   cancer ([166]6,[167]7). Although transportation insecurity
   among patients with cancer is thought to be common, prevalence
   estimates range widely across published studies. For example,
   nearly 90% of women in the National Breast and Cervical Cancer
   Early Detection Program and 75% of adults in the Colorectal
   Cancer Control Program self-reported lack of transportation as
   a barrier to screening ([168]10). These programs assist
   low-income adults without adequate health insurance coverage in
   receiving screening. However, in a sample of veterans with
   colorectal cancer, 2 studies estimated that approximately 20%
   of patients self-reported transportation as a barrier to cancer
   care ([169]8,[170]9). Finally, a recent analysis of the
   nationally representative National Health Interview Survey
   found that only 3.1% of cancer survivors self-reported delaying
   care because of transportation barriers ([171]6). These widely
   disparate prevalence estimates may reflect differences related
   to timing along the cancer care continuum (screening,
   treatment, survivorship), clinical population (breast cancer,
   colorectal cancer, all types of cancer), health insurance
   coverage and associated programs to address transportation
   insecurity (primarily Medicaid and underinsured, coverage
   through the Veterans Affairs Health System, inclusion of
   patients with Medicare or private insurance), or differences in
   sampling technique and study design (single institution study,
   national samples from household surveys).

Consequences of Transportation Insecurity Among Patients With Cancer

   The deleterious consequences of transportation insecurity occur
   at multiple levels ([174]Table 2). Patients may forego, miss,
   delay, alter, or prematurely terminate necessary cancer care
   along the continuum ([175]20,[176]21) leading to missed or
   delayed administration of systemic therapies, radiation, and
   surgery ([177]11), potentially impairing these efforts and
   resulting in higher rates of cancer recurrence and worse
   survival ([178]7). In addition to the direct cost of travel,
   time spent traveling to and from care represents an opportunity
   cost—time that cannot be spent at work or in usual activities.
   Patient ([179]22,[180]23) and caregiver ([181]24) time costs
   associated with cancer-directed therapy can be substantial, at
   the individual and national levels. A recent study estimated
   that for patients with advanced cancer, treatment-related time
   toxicity (ie, loss of time incurred receiving cancer treatment)
   may offset modest survival gains offered by some treatments
   ([182]25). From the provider and health system perspective,
   when a patient cancels an appointment at the last minute or
   fails to arrive because of a transportation barrier, the
   complex cancer treatment process is interrupted. For health
   systems, transportation insecurity can result in lost revenue
   due to rescheduling patients and/or making alternative
   arrangements as well as underutilization and vacancies (eg,
   clinic, infusion suites, radiology). There is, thus, a strong
   financial incentive for health systems to minimize
   transportation-related barriers to cancer care.

Screening for Transportation Insecurity Among Patients With Cancer

   Because of increasing evidence that interventions addressing
   social needs such as transportation may improve health outcomes
   and decrease the cost of care ([185]26,[186]27), there is
   growing consensus about the importance of screening for
   transportation insecurity ([187]28). Among patients with
   cancer, transportation insecurity can be assessed using a
   variety of different approaches. One strategy measures
   insecurity by assessing travel difficulty via proxy measures
   such as time spent traveling to a provider, travel distance to
   available facilities, cost of transportation, and car ownership
   ([188]1,[189]4,[190]20). Transportation insecurity can also be
   assessed by its consequences such as disruption of care or
   delays in care ([191]3,[192]7). Single items within broader
   point-of-service measures using this approach are available for
   screening in clinical (eg, Accountable Health Communities
   Screening Tool, American Academy of Family Physicians Social
   Needs Screening Tool) and research (eg, National Health
   Interview Survey) domains. Transportation insecurity can also
   be assessed by direct patient report via structured assessments
   such as the Transportation Barriers Measure ([193]17) or
   open-ended questions such as “do you have difficulty with
   transportation to get to or from treatment?” ([194]9). Finally,
   the Gravity Project is a multistakeholder national public
   collaborative launched in May 2019 that seeks to develop
   consensus-based data standards of individual-level social
   determinants of health (including transportation) for
   integration into digital platforms using International
   Classification of Disease and Related Health Problems–10 or
   Systematized Nomenclature of Medicine - Clinical Terms
   (SNOMED-CT) codes ([195]2).

Efforts to Address Transportation Insecurity for Patients With Cancer

   [196]Table 3 highlights ongoing efforts to address
   transportation insecurity at the policy, health system,
   not-for-profit, and industry levels. Transportation insecurity
   is optimally addressed using an upstream approach; as such,
   federal and state policy is critical ([197]19). Nonemergency
   medical transportation (NEMT), which provides rides to medical
   appointments for eligible Medicaid beneficiaries, is the
   largest program addressing health-care–related transportation.
   In fiscal year 2018, state and federal spending on
   fee-for-service NEMT was $2.6 billion ([198]29). However, when
   Medicaid-managed care organizations costs are included, NEMT
   expenditures were estimated at nearly $5.5 billion ([199]30).
   Although there are relatively robust federal programs for
   health-care–related transportation for Medicaid beneficiaries
   and veterans, there is a large gap in federal policy for
   Medicare beneficiaries, those with private insurance, and those
   with no health insurance coverage. One program specifically
   targeting Medicare beneficiaries is the Repetitive Scheduled
   Non-Emergency Ambulance Transport. This small and specialized
   program involves ambulance transportation for those needing at
   least 1 round trip per week for at least 3 weeks. Medicare
   Advantage enrollees also have access to transportation benefits
   if their plan adopts transportation as a supplemental benefit.
   To date, there has been almost no adoption of transportation
   benefits within private employer–based programs or individual
   exchange markets.

   At a more downstream level, health systems have developed
   programs to address transportation insecurity among patients
   with cancer. One example is the University of Illinois Health’s
   PROgram for Non-emergency TranspOrtation (PRONTO) program
   ([210]31). PRONTO is a partnership between the University of
   Illinois Health and Kaizen Health (a local health-access
   start-up) that provides free rides to patients being
   transitioned home from inpatient and ambulatory clinics (eg,
   the cancer center), addressing transportation insecurity for
   patients with cancer like Dorothy Baily—the patient featured at
   the start of this commentary. PRONTO offers free rides to
   approximately 100 to 120 patients per month of whom 80% travel
   to areas that score high on the Centers for Disease Control and
   Prevention Social Vulnerability Index ([211]32). One study
   evaluating the efficacy of a rideshare-based intervention found
   that it did not decrease missed appointments ([212]33).
   However, 2 recent studies among cancer patients with
   transportation barriers undergoing radiation therapy showed
   that rideshare programs are acceptable ([213]34) and that
   transportation logistics hubs utilizing rideshare-based
   transportation may decrease no-show rates and result in
   cost-savings to the health system ([214]35). In addition, other
   studies have suggested that transportation vouchers are an
   acceptable method of addressing transportation insecurity among
   patients with cancer, with 1 study reporting that
   transportation vouchers were the preferred method ([215]35).

   Not-for-profit organizations such as the American Cancer
   Society have developed programs to address transportation
   insecurity among patients with cancer. American Cancer
   Society’s Road to Recovery Program uses volunteer drivers who
   donate their time and personal automobiles to assist patients
   with cancer who need a ride to or from a clinical encounter.
   This program operates in all 50 states and has provided more
   than 9 million rides to more than 400 000 patients with cancer
   since 1981. Since 2016, the American Cancer Society has also
   awarded more than $3 million to 225 hospitals through its
   transportation grants program, providing 7500 patients with
   cancer in rural or unsafe urban areas with 100 000 rides.
   Finally, for patients with cancer who face extended periods of
   daily treatment and require specialized centers of excellence,
   the solution to transportation insecurity may be provision of
   housing. Through its Hope Lodge program, the American Cancer
   Society offers cancer patients and their caregivers a free
   place to stay when their best hope for effective treatment is
   in another city. Despite the long-standing history and high
   utilization of programs such as those provided by the American
   Cancer Society, further research is needed to evaluate the
   impact of these programs on patient-centered outcomes.

   Corporations are also developing innovative platforms to
   address transportation insecurity among patients with cancer.
   Rideshare companies have developed business-to-business
   platforms for sending and scheduling rides that can be used by
   case managers and nurses. These platforms, which do not require
   the passenger to have the company’s app or a cell phone, have
   the potential to address the unmet need for on-demand
   cost-effective NEMT solutions ([216]30) for inpatient and
   outpatient discharges and on-demand ride to screening and
   clinical appointments ([217]11). In addition to brokers that
   have historically provided NEMT such as ModivCare (formerly
   LogistiCare), MTM, and Southeastrans, there are newer,
   technology-forward NEMT brokers and coordination platforms such
   as Kaizen Health, SafeRide Health, Ride Health, and Roundtrip
   that partner with health-care organizations, health plans, and
   transportation providers to schedule on-demand patient
   transportation. Recognizing the critical role of transportation
   to oncology clinical trial participation ([218]36,[219]37),
   trial sponsors have developed initiatives to address
   transportation insecurity via vendor-sponsored travel
   agreements for patients with transportation barriers who wish
   to participate in clinical trials.

Policy Agenda for Addressing Transportation Insecurity for Patients With Cancer

   There are numerous potential state and federal policy levers to
   address transportation insecurity for patients with cancer.
   Regulators and payors put standards in place to assure both
   quality of care and cost management. Some of these are
   regulated at the federal level, some at the state level, and
   some by individual private payors. All parties recognize that
   high-quality care not only results in the best outcomes for
   patients but is potentially less costly than low-quality care.
   Federal and state policy makers (or payors) could consider a
   directive to require or incentivize screening for
   transportation insecurity and provision of interventions to
   overcome transportation barriers as part of other initiatives
   to enhance the delivery of high-quality care. A number of
   organizations that seek to catalyze improvements in the quality
   of health-care delivery such as the National Quality Forum and
   National Committee for Quality Assurance have advocated for
   similar proposals in recent years ([220]38,[221]39). It is
   likely that a modest investment to provide transportation to
   patients in need would have a positive return on investment, as
   has already been demonstrated for cancer screening ([222]40).
   These efforts could be managed at the level of the oncology
   practice with a modest administrative burden. Ultimately,
   transportation assistance for patients in need could be viewed
   as another critical aspect of high-quality cancer care.

   There are also a number of changes to existing federal and
   state policy that govern NEMT that could help address
   transportation insecurity among patients with cancer. First,
   NEMT could be a benefit for all Medicare enrollees instead of
   only as a supplemental benefit for those enrolled in eligible
   Medicare Advantage plans. Second, policy efforts could remove
   unnecessary restrictions that limit uptake of services. For
   example, Medicaid NEMT in some states require planning trips
   72 hours in advance for prior authorization, which can limit
   use of Medicaid NEMT following hospital discharge. Third,
   changes to existing policy governing NEMT could enhance
   equitable participation in clinical trials ([223]5). Starting
   in January 2022, the Center for Medicaid and Children’s Health
   Insurance Program services outlined new Medicaid state plan
   requirements for assuring coverage of routine patient costs
   associated with participation in qualifying clinical trials for
   Medicaid beneficiaries ([224]41). However, some states have
   limited the NEMT benefits as part of Medicaid expansion. To
   realize the full benefit of this coverage mandate in terms of
   trial participation, additional state and federal policy steps
   to provide Medicaid NEMT benefits for trial-associated
   appointments for those with transportation insecurity appear
   necessary ([225]5). Fourth, policy makers could consider
   national paid leave. Such a policy would not only enable
   working patients the time to receive care but would also allow
   informal caregivers to accompany patients to and from their
   cancer care. Finally, recognizing that transportation
   insecurity often co-exists with other social needs such as
   financial toxicity, food insecurity, and housing insecurity
   ([226]9,[227]18,[228]19), future policy changes could explore
   opportunities for synergy and coordination across public sector
   transportation and social service programs. For example,
   although there is substantial overlap between Supplemental
   Nutrition Assistance Program and Medicaid beneficiaries, most
   Medicaid programs don’t allow for trips to the grocery store to
   use Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program benefits.
   Leveraging transportation-based solutions to address food
   insecurity has the potential to improve outcomes along the
   continuum for patients with cancer.

Data Infrastructure Research Agenda to Address Transportation Insecurity for Patients With Cancer

   Despite substantial progress characterizing, understanding, and
   addressing health-care–related transportation insecurity among
   patients with cancer, there is still a critical need for
   research and evidence across several fronts ([229]Table 4).
   First, there is lack of precise data about the prevalence of,
   and risk factors for, transportation insecurity specifically
   among patients with cancer. To date, transportation insecurity
   research has focused primarily on general medical care, not
   specifically cancer care ([230]4). Among the studies that have
   evaluated the prevalence of transportation insecurity related
   to cancer care, estimates have ranged widely, from 3.1% to
   86.6% ([231]6,[232]10). Despite the wide variation in point
   estimates, it is clear that patients with cancer face special
   transportation-related challenges and are at high risk for
   transportation insecurity relative to patients without cancer
   ([233]6,[234]7). Characterizing the scope of transportation
   insecurity among patients with cancer is thus a critical next
   step. In addition, there is likely heterogeneity within
   different oncology patient populations. Patients with cancer
   can experience specific impairments that affect mobility,
   cognition, and physical function; these impairments can vary
   substantially based on specific cancer diagnoses, locations,
   and treatment decisions. This variability may dictate the types
   of needed services (eg, gurney vans, bus pass, ridesharing) at
   different points along the course of treatment. Understanding
   which patients with cancer need what level of service at what
   point(s) in their cancer care journey is critically important
   to achieving more patient-centered and efficient service.

   Second, there is a lack of evidence-based guidelines for
   screening for transportation insecurity among patients with
   cancer. Screening for transportation insecurity and documenting
   how patients are connected to resources is beginning to occur
   in the primary care setting ([237]42-45), however, it does not
   routinely occur in the context of cancer care. This practice
   gap reflects a lack of evidence related to who to screen (eg,
   everyone, risk adjusted), the screening instruments to use (eg,
   widely accepted, validated screening instruments with construct
   validity among patients with cancer), when to screen (eg,
   before cancer treatment, during cancer treatment), how
   frequently to screen (eg, regularly, event based), where to
   screen (eg, in communities, in clinics), how to screen (eg,
   paper based, electronic health record, phone survey), who
   should be involved in the screening (eg, social workers, cancer
   clinicians), and whether patients find social needs screening
   questions acceptable while undergoing cancer treatment.
   Accurate identification of patients with transportation
   insecurity using evidence-based screening tools is key to
   appropriately allocating transportation-related resources.

   Third, more data about consequences of transportation
   insecurity at the patient, caregiver, provider, health system,
   and society levels are necessary. Transportation insecurity
   also frequently co-occurs with other social needs such as food
   and housing insecurity; the independent and combined effects of
   these different social needs among patients with cancer need to
   be characterized to inform the development, implementation, and
   evaluation of interventions aimed at addressing transportation
   insecurity. On one hand, interventions to address
   transportation insecurity have the potential for efficiency and
   synergy if they can be leveraged to address concurrent social,
   housing, and food insecurity. On the other hand, if attempts to
   address transportation insecurity ignore other social needs,
   the impact of these programs may be limited. Providing a ride
   home from the hospital but failing to address concurrent
   social, housing, or food needs may lessen the effectiveness and
   impact of transportation insecurity interventions. High-quality
   comprehensive longitudinal data are needed to help untangle
   these complex relationships and evaluate the consequences of
   ongoing and future interventions to decrease transportation
   insecurity among patients with cancer.

   Fourth, more research is needed to evaluate the effectiveness
   and economic impact of transportation insecurity initiatives at
   the federal and state policy, health system, not-for-profit,
   and corporate levels, particularly among patients with cancer.
   To date, studies have assessed the effectiveness of medical
   transportation interventions using proximal outcomes such as
   health-care utilization and missed appointments ([238]30). More
   robust data about patient health outcomes are needed. In
   addition, the economic impacts of transportation in cancer care
   may consider a more expansive perspective for payers and
   providers, including long-term savings from early cancer
   detection and fewer cancer treatment disruptions resulting in
   better treatment outcomes and a reduction in cancer
   disparities. Even more critical, transportation could be a
   stabilizing factor for patients undergoing cancer care who are
   more likely to experience medical financial hardship
   ([239]46,[240]47) and lean on informal caregivers who similarly
   benefit from the time and financial costs saved by stable and
   reliable transportation. Articulating the economic impacts of
   addressing transportation insecurity for payors, providers, and
   patients can inform policy and payment changes, evidence that
   is urgently needed to support and address social needs, risk
   factors, and determinants of health that have long afflicted
   patients along the cancer care continuum.

   Health-care–related transportation insecurity is one of the
   most important barriers to care for patients with cancer
   ([241]20) as disruptions in care can lead to poor outcomes and
   preventable death. Recognizing that transportation is a
   critical determinant of guideline-concordant care and related
   outcomes for patients with cancer, there has been substantial
   progress in our understanding of the multifaceted nature of
   this condition and its consequences for patients, caregivers,
   oncologists, health systems, and society. There are ongoing
   efforts to develop evidence-based protocols to identify
   patients at risk for transportation insecurity and address
   transportation insecurity at federal policy, health system,
   not-for-profit, and industry levels. However, critical
   knowledge gaps exist in each of these areas. A research agenda
   across several fronts is proposed to enhance our ability to
   understand and address health-care–related transportation
   insecurity among patients with cancer. Reducing transportation
   barriers to care should be a priority of our health-care system
   and has tremendous potential to impact outcomes for patients,
   caregivers, oncologists, and health systems.
