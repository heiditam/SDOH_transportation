    "* The social determinants of health (SDOH) are non-medical factors that can influence public health (WHO). <br>\n",
    "* Factors based on <a href=\"https://www.annualreviews.org/content/journals/10.1146/annurev-publhealth-031210-101218\">The Social Determinants of Health: Coming of Age</a> are: <br>\n",
    "    * <u>Neighbourhood Conditions:</u> social + physical environments; individual health\n",
    "    * <u>Working Conditions:</u> employment-related factors (the physical aspects of working as well as the work environment; psychosocial aspects; opportunities & resources)\n",
    "    * <u>Education:</u> educational opportunities and the social & psychological factors associated\n",
    "    * <u>Income & Wealth:</u> socioeconomic status, the environment one grows up with, and the resources they have access to\n",
    "    * <u>Race & Racism:</u> racial disparities in health & healthcare\n",
    "    * <u>Stress:</u> psychological stressors (their causes & effects)\n",
    "* I have also identified common themes between these classifications, and made note of them, as follows: \n",
    "\n",
    "    * <u>Environment</u>: the physical landscape of the environment, services available, individual health, the physical aspects of work (eg muscle strain, back pain), the work environment (eg collaborative, desk space, etc), area demographics, economic hardship, racial discrimination, relative social status\n",
    "    * <u>Social/Psychological</u>: social relationships, individual health, stress, subjective social status, self-perception\n",
    "    * <u>Opportunities & Resources</u>: literacy, employment opportunities, literacy, income/wealth, education, social safety nets, Medicare, etc.\n",
    "    * <u>Biological Effects</u>: release of cortisol & cytokines, ageing, disease\n",
    "* Socioeconomic factors (SEFs) such as income, education, and employment play a crucial role in shaping transportation accessibility and health outcomes. \n",
    "* From the list above, we are interested in investigating **accessibility and transportation** which falls under the category of **Neighbourhood Conditions** because they are related to the social and physical environment people live in, which affects people's mobility and daily life activities\n",
    "* Accessibility to transportation is also deeply tied with the other themes since socioeconomic status can affect vehicle ownership and access. Lack of transportation can cause psychological stress and increase daily burdens. Having limited transportation also limits access to healthcare, a solid education, and a stable job. All these factors affect people's overall well-being."

    "* **Health:** a person's physical, mental, and emotional well-being in a general sense, not necessarily related to the social determinants of health<br>\n",
    "* **Privilege:** this may be mentioned a lot if SDOH is found to favor some people over others<br>\n",
    "* **Socioeconomic status:** a measurement of where people stand socially or economically; this may be crucial to the social determinants of health<br>\n",
    "* **Transportation:** we are interested in whether an association exists between transportation and the social determinants of health. By looking at positive/negative sentiment of the word along with topics related to privilege and socioeconomic status, we can get a better understanding of how inequalities in accessibility to transportation affect public health.<br>"

commented used go son s place all time able anymore talked grandchildren saddened fact restrictions seeing family disconnecting us everyone similarly referring covid dora noted it s really affected cause i m really close family that s really affected me seeing contact them know ring that together seeing one another hugging grandkids laughs yeah i ve really missed that participants faced challenges navigating transportation system carrying kinship priorities made challenges tolerable and times worth it rowena explained get my daughter s place it s like three buses rang told saturday grandson s making confirmation can t come pick cause she s got much get three boys ready church get husband organised went you re gonna make way there mum i m sorry said that s okay didn t wanna miss it know it s special moment said i ll there don t worry me i ll get there things like don t mind part community participants voiced desire go places part community speaking elder s group simone described main thing does giving central role day to day life looks forward every tuesday said co ordinators make feel loved look them sisters now that s they ve done me mean look much they ve given me they ve given love back strength back able get front door something it s important us group it s incredible value participants place community emphasised reflected impact covid ability maintain social connections rowena explained doctor told go self isolation march last year it s hard can t see anyone so i ve myself so know i d sit talk cat gets sick talking puts sleep wardrobe so was um stressful depressing and know good thoughts feelings isolated long horrible time part community priority participants that times compelled endure challenges associated getting places community first instance although commute hours way via multiple bus train trips volunteer community engagement role rowena remarked i didn t mind loved ringing elders interestingly community appeared value obligation suggested rowena s comment covid hit bit relief cause didn t emphasis added get four hours traveling every day but know since covid everything we ve home so know that s good connecting culture participants out of home activities also represent opportunities connect family heritage culture simone told story coming together brother cousins country visiting grave sites great great great grandparents finally putting together puzzle pieces family history eric discussed participation men s group opportunity spend time uncles make cultural artefacts able go pursue activities negatively affected participants cultural well being referring covid restrictions movement eric noted hard cultural way yeah back country know we re used people around know people weren t allowed come see or whatever like that bad thing sense unease participants felt covid stemmed limitations ability connect culture also concerns safety community individuals keepers stewards aboriginal culture simone explained what s covid done me i m frightened now i m frightened go out fear know lot elders getting there uh cause that s thing that s bothering me too cause we re losing elders it s every one indigenous mob know it s hitting people culture going use transport participants utilised multiple modes transportation access out of home activities including walking for short trips train light rail bus participants met eligibility criteria qualified assessment also used transport services funded australian government s aged care scheme national disability insurance scheme ndis respectively schemes eligible qualified participants allocated specific amount funded transport services must arrange services themselves destination choosing private service providers include community transport organisations transport community transport buses home care organisations transport personal vehicles driven individual carers provide assistance everyday living participants also used transport organised individual services like local ngo sometimes transport participants location programs services held lastly participants arranged transport informal social arrangements participants get driven family members friends carpool peers going destination using transport participants negotiate several barriers including rules procedures transport system temporal complexity uncertainty stigma condescension rules procedures transport system physical design public transport systems may include accommodations people varying mobility levels service design terms rules norms governing user experience may not several participants voiced struggle navigate public transport walker gave examples lift walker buses well maneuverer lifts platforms train stations one way participants negotiate rules procedures transport system pertain physical accessibility explained ivan started using walker rang transport new south wales transport new south wales publicly funded state transport agency and asked about uh ramp the thing use wheelchairs said anyone got walking aid even walking stick allowed use ramp go and next bus asking can use ramp mate says no that s wheelchairs said um well transport new south wales said use it no no no no sorry can t use it no no that really got me know would ring transport new south wales again said they re supposed let use it take down driver s number bus number route time ring us back tell us we ll tell bus driver kept going months like every year said why don t tell bus drivers disability people oh can t that complain it know i m thinking ridiculous oh getting really frustrating yeah another set rules procedures standing participants use transport involves need schedule community transport advance participants preferred community transport convenience time travel comes major inconvenience prior travel participants expressed need book community transport advance which understandable service provider perspective compatible reality needing travel spontaneously rowena explained you ve gotta give them like three days notice get transport sometimes you re sick need go day you re sick don t money taxi know makes hard community transport providers best ask problem transport option unable travel community transport short notice means able attend out of home activity commitments transport options resort less desirable option taking bus comes temporal complexity uncertainty see next subsection hassle public transport compared community transport status second choice option community transport emphasised throughout interviews one participant found need book advance challenging public transport seemed easy comparison eric contrasted inconvenience needing book community transport advance ease deciding take public transport moment for community transport it s pretty hard you ve got ring couple days book that part really hard easy part is like said catch train go west side rules procedures broader social care system also impede participants ability travel valued activities destinations asked transport support ndis one participant provided insight process qualifying ndis benefits participant s situation repeatedly turned benefits prompted revealed unsure advocate needs knowing supports services available addressing question transport support ndis eric responded that s laugh couple years ago saying don t register i m going lose benefits that s letter said think i ve still got it that rang up asked forms everything mailed away got email back saying sorry can t put on joke me joke thought well you re kidding aren t you right thing got doctor sort everything out said sorry don t qualify thought well problems got shouldn t problems getting ndis no didn t want me interviewer noted eric able request care plan cultural support terms travel assistance ancestral lands eric remarked oh didn t know that thought it d going bit overboard asking that especially since didn t want anything me one thing would love do it s something i ve never done before it s past years i ve actually known aboriginal side i m wanting know more participant s experience suggests challenges navigating rules procedures broader social care systems hinder one s ability pursue meaningful life activities temporal complexity uncertainty describing experiences public transport participants commented burden places time aside wait bus due infrequent irregular bus schedules participants described need co ordinate multiple bus train times rowena provided example used go office blacktown to volunteer local ngo used catch bus at um morning place to um chester hill station i d get bus stay bus stop seven minutes later another bus came used get parramatta i d get parramatta catch train parramatta blacktown it d take two hours morning sometimes it d take two half hours maybe three coming home public transport associated significant time demands complexity planning also compels participants tolerate level uncertainty time rowena described traveling visit friends family able stay long due need adhere public transport timetables would sometimes need take taxi destination know would leave home taking bus friends like live different suburbs so wanna go visit them sometimes it s like four buses day can t stay long you re trying work timetable so it s really hard catch people get my daughter s place it s like three buses rang told saturday grandson s making confirmation so i m gonna catch taxi go there because know don t know what time i d leave home get church time would catch couple buses temporal complexity uncertainty shaping restricting way participants able live lives fulfil kinship obligations preferences rowena summarised impact lack bus service sundays public holidays succinctly stating that result you re stuck house can t go visit anybody anyway stigma participants provided examples stigma contend engaging out of home activities experience relates to goes far beyond use transportation ada recounted experience relating colour skin started referring dentist appointment went via train get train bus get feeling should not it s one feelings know even planes too doesn t matter go dear get funny feeling that oh belong not reflecting experience stigmatised ada first thought various transport modes used then recalled similar experiences public places it s public transport it s everywhere we ve got stigma shouldn t there could going lunch know feel walk doors um pools go to activities pools stare going to um even shopping could walk apartment unit they d say oh what s doin comin there going into know important places doctor sends ya like hospitals get door corridor boom eyes stare ya must think oh doin here there s nationalities know one place pick us say youse don t belong here they re land aren t they feeling referred led ada question right public continued think are entitled there like think oh get koorie bus people koorie train people like i ve lot of um restaurants and think should eat fast get out white person come along know for them say oh she s him that must okay know condescension participants also discussed treatment received others interacting transportation system experience stigmatised attitude disapproval discrimination directed them here participants describing behaviour others toward them continuing earlier account negotiating bus drivers use ramp ivan described way treated him refusing let ramp someone would say what old ladies are getting on bus can t get up type thing abuse you least one person said me what think are king laughs bus drivers famous eh treating you like you re rubbish condescending treatment ivan received bus drivers directed mobility impairment need walker continued even going shop woman who served treating like uh like little kid like people i ve noticed that lot people treat disability people uh though they ve got physical disability there s also mental disability there way talk you interactions ivan treated service professionals though superior reducing someone like little kid like rubbish participants shared experiences negative treatment others ignored rendered invisible paul s account presence acknowledged personal space encroached upon rowena s account need assistance responded to cause i ve got arthritis that i ve got use lift to access trains sometimes it s hard get

evidence support transportation key sdoh rural-dwelling older adults. such, transportation specifically addressed healthcare restructuring initiatives aim support aging-in-place. service providers need advocate system-wide solutions integrating transportation healthcare system, imperative decision-makers act solutions. introduction older adults living rural semi urban areas increase age, mobility often decreases (mattson, ). one key component mobility transportation (webber, porter, & menec, ). reliable transportation provides access needed healthcare services, helps maintain social connections, vital communities considered healthy. people limited access transportation may experience delayed medical appointments, poor health outcomes, increased utilization health care services – increase healthcare costs (health research & educational trust, ). however, restructuring healthcare services always take consideration transportation social determinant health (sdoh) complex role plays impacting health outcomes older adults, particularly live rural remote regions. paper reports multifaceted nature transportation social determinant health drawing perspective older adults living interior british columbia (bc), canada. paper un\\xad earths lack transportation options, particularly bc’s rural re\\xad gions, discusses negative impact older adults’ ability age place. background designing restructuring initiative promote aging-in-place, interior health (ih), one six health authorities bc, decided specific social determinants health (sdoh) “need addressed mitigated” specifically named transportation, along housing, food security, limited financial resources, social connectedness (kamloops local action team [lat], , p. ). sdoh social environmental factors negatively impact health cause exacerbate disease. well-known utilized canadian sdoh models include (mikkonen & raphael, ) (health canada, ) determinants, including income (distribution social status), education, housing, employment working conditions, gender, social exclusion/supports, (access to) health services, childhood devel\\xad opment/experiences. neither models include trans\\xad portation, crucial role transportation older adults’ access health care services widely understood social gerontologists geographers (chappell, ), addressed within context rural transportation options (hansen et al., ). kamloops lat () include transportation sdoh, recommendations arising health service restructuring plan older adults include solutions mitigate known unknown transportation problems experienced older adults, particularly dwelling rural areas. office seniors advocate, () identified following options bc seniors longer drive: ask family friends, walk, use public transit, take handydart, call taxicab, use volunteer driver programs. handydart free public trans\\xad portation service older adults persons disabilities; clients need register handydart, pre-book trips two

first nations health authority (fnha, ), covers costs accommodation, meals, mileage. older adults families communities must fill gaps assume additional costs. due limited unaffordable transportation options available, advocacy groups like bc alliance healthy living () call increased transportation options small towns rural communities, noting need expand handydart service include evenings, sundays, holidays; engage health authorities creating ways ensure health care access. older adults must travel urban centers non-emergency medical appointments, also health connections bus runs two

public transportation recommended policy intervention facilitate aging rural canada (bascu et al., ; see also seniors advocate bc, ). groups older adults adversely affected transportation barriers others, including low income, female, less educated, older minority individuals (syed, gerber, & sharp, ). example, call et al.’s () survey research access health care services found % american indians experienced transportation barriers contrast % nonhispanic white americans. older adults living disabilities included syed et al.’s () list impacted trans\\xad portation barriers, yet likely due biomedicalization aging equating ‘older’ ‘disabled’. transportation challenges easy resolve. survey people communities manitoba (canadian province) examined age-friendliness showed “transportation

participants lived income less $, per year. unsurprisingly, transportation major topic conversation focus groups (fg) interviews (int), regardless community size. study shows complexity transportation relates older adults getting primary community care neighboring community, well receiving home com\\xad munity care health care providers must travel urban center. one participant said, “sometimes isn’t always people need[ing] come health care, health care needs come people” (fg , srt ). specialists urban centers able travel rural towns year around. example, diabetic nurse specialist makes monthly visits, except winter holidays, “…the cardi\\xad ologist comes [hospital nearby rural town], won’t, un\\xad derstandably so, [come up] winter. know, wants risk driving road [in mountains]?” (fg , srt ). inclement weather impacts health care providers, also rural-dwelling older adults needing travel urban centers health care: “i would say [transportation is] one biggest issues i’d say lot

finding someone drive them: well, neighbor go kelowna -min procedure cost two nights hotel meals, plus driving back forth [~ miles round trip]. getting someone can’t drive condition, system downloaded lot costs sector least afford – patient (fg, srt ). long distance medical appointments urban centers cost travel raised frequently, one participant suggesting older adults miss appointments save money time: “…there’s three hours travel time go kamloops back again. kelowna, well, even longer…plus price gas. me, okay, suck up, lot people [they might think]: ‘oh goodness! don’t know whether afford run length time’” (int, srt ). opted drive back forth rather paying hotel eligible $ reimbursement travel costs first nations health authority noted cover actual travel costs, particularly driving old (non-fuel-efficient) vehicles. one indigenous elder stated, medical appointments large urban centers (e.g., vancouver) deemed extremely valuable service, eliminate transportation challenges, dialogue indicates: p: one bonuses health connections bus though. it’s five dollar, ten round-trip [cost]. get [small rural town remote location] connect it. p: get picked dropped certain places kam\\xad loops (fg , srt ). solution, study participants suggested “a total health center” “one-stop shopping”, meant co-location health care services: “i think one-stop shopping thing… sort [health care services]

). complexity transportation issues rural-dwelling older adults pertains barriers (financial, environmental, linguistic, cultural) accessing medically necessary health care services urban centers well

example transportation issues look like older adult. case rural-dwelling older adult’s access health care services older adult living williams lake, rural town three hours ( miles) northwest kamloops,

independent combined effects different social needs among patients cancer need characterized inform development, implementation, evaluation interventions aimed addressing transportation insecurity. one hand, interventions address transportation insecurity potential efficiency synergy leveraged address concurrent social, housing, food insecurity. hand, attempts address transportation insecurity ignore social needs, impact programs may limited. providing ride home hospital failing address concurrent social, housing, food needs may lessen effectiveness impact transportation insecurity interventions. high-quality comprehensive longitudinal data needed help untangle complex relationships evaluate consequences ongoing future interventions decrease transportation insecurity among patients cancer. fourth, research needed evaluate effectiveness economic impact transportation insecurity initiatives federal state policy, health system, not-for-profit, corporate levels, particularly among patients cancer. date, studies assessed effectiveness medical transportation interventions using proximal outcomes health-care utilization missed appointments ([]). robust data patient health outcomes needed. addition, economic impacts transportation cancer care may consider expansive perspective payers providers, including long-term savings early cancer detection fewer cancer treatment disruptions resulting better treatment outcomes reduction cancer disparities. even critical, transportation could stabilizing factor patients undergoing cancer care likely experience medical financial hardship ([],[]) lean informal caregivers similarly benefit time financial costs saved stable reliable transportation. articulating economic impacts addressing transportation insecurity payors, providers, patients inform policy payment changes, evidence urgently needed support address social needs, risk factors, determinants health long afflicted patients along cancer care continuum. health-care–related transportation insecurity one important barriers care patients cancer ([]) disruptions care lead poor outcomes preventable death. recognizing transportation critical determinant guideline-concordant care related outcomes patients cancer, substantial progress understanding multifaceted nature condition consequences patients, caregivers, oncologists, health systems, society. ongoing efforts develop evidence-based protocols identify patients risk transportation insecurity address transportation insecurity federal policy, health system, not-for-profit, industry levels. however, critical knowledge gaps exist areas. research agenda across several fronts proposed enhance ability understand address health-care–related transportation insecurity among patients cancer. reducing transportation barriers care priority health-care system tremendous potential impact outcomes patients, caregivers, oncologists, health systems.'"
