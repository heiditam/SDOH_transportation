    "    * <u>Education:</u> educational opportunities and the social & psychological factors associated\n",
    "    * <u>Income & Wealth:</u> socioeconomic status, the environment one grows up with, and the resources they have access to\n",
    "    * <u>Race & Racism:</u> racial disparities in health & healthcare\n",
    "    * <u>Stress:</u> psychological stressors (their causes & effects)\n",
    "* I have also identified common themes between these classifications, and made note of them, as follows: \n",
    "\n",
    "    * <u>Environment</u>: the physical landscape of the environment, services available, individual health, the physical aspects of work (eg muscle strain, back pain), the work environment (eg collaborative, desk space, etc), area demographics, economic hardship, racial discrimination, relative social status\n",
    "    * <u>Social/Psychological</u>: social relationships, individual health, stress, subjective social status, self-perception\n",
    "    * <u>Opportunities & Resources</u>: literacy, employment opportunities, literacy, income/wealth, education, social safety nets, Medicare, etc.\n",
    "    * <u>Biological Effects</u>: release of cortisol & cytokines, ageing, disease\n",
    "* Socioeconomic factors (SEFs) such as income, education, and employment play a crucial role in shaping transportation accessibility and health outcomes. \n",
    "* From the list above, we are interested in investigating **accessibility and transportation** which falls under the category of **Neighbourhood Conditions** because they are related to the social and physical environment people live in, which affects people's mobility and daily life activities\n",
    "* Accessibility to transportation is also deeply tied with the other themes since socioeconomic status can affect vehicle ownership and access. Lack of transportation can cause psychological stress and increase daily burdens. Having limited transportation also limits access to healthcare, a solid education, and a stable job. All these factors affect people's overall well-being."

intentionally unintentionally maintain status quo inequity institutions influence influenced social structure government institutions play key roles addressing social inequities health disparities therefore enhancing cancer control efforts broader engagement institutional partners across varied sectors warranted despite need impact institutional characteristics cancer related disparities inadequately understood examining individual factors alone insufficient understanding social phenomena socioeconomic disparities cancer example individual educational attainment account policies

risk make prioritizing health difficult and or reduce access cancer screening diagnosis high quality treatment individuals living poverty less likely access health care likely others diagnosed cancer advanced stages successful treatment difficult analysis decades data consistently found residents socioeconomically deprived areas higher cancer mortality incidence rates compared affluent counterparts most notably colorectal liver stomach lung cervical cancers access employment opportunities also impact cancer related disparities even individuals employed may lack job security livable wage adequate benefits all health implications health insurance coverage working age population predominantly employment based limited employment opportunities restrict access affordable employer sponsored insurance coverage patients families workplace benefits paid sick leave flexibility work schedules locations may influence one s ability maintain employment health insurance coverage receiving cancer treatment obtaining preventive care supporting loved one seeking timely preventive ongoing care addition adverse financial impact cost cancer care ie financial toxicity presents additional economic burden out of pocket costs physical environment personal autonomy notwithstanding behaviors decision making often occur context physical environment example maintaining healthy weight living physically active lifestyle following healthy diet reduce risk developing dying cancer healthy eating physical activity behaviors improve treatment outcomes quality life patients cancer however disadvantaged patients may unable comply health care provider recommendations increase healthy food consumption factors beyond control geographic availability healthy options many impoverished neighborhoods nutrient poor foods abundant often highly marketed cheap convenient access manufactured physical design neighborhood built environment also influence adherence provider recommendations high poverty areas significantly fewer sports areas parks greenways compared lower poverty areas thereby limiting opportunities physical activity built environment also puts individuals impoverished communities risk food insecurity disruption food intake eating patterns lack financial resources food insecurity may result individuals purchasing inexpensive unhealthy foods forgoing food pay living medical expenses another important aspect physical environment housing lack quality housing disproportionately exposes disadvantaged communities secondhand smoke asbestos radon cancer risks addition disadvantaged communities often experience housing instability from homelessness unsafe unsanitary living conditions severe rent burden resulting poor access preventive health care cancer screenings homeless population particularly risk homeless adults twice likely die cancer non homeless adults united states social environment social environment exert especially strong influences health social networks among disadvantaged groups differ among nondisadvantaged groups keeping disadvantaged individuals disconnected others might provide connections economic opportunity resources social isolation measure one s limited social contact networks disproportionately prevalent among socioeconomically disadvantaged populations chronically ill racial ethnic minority groups associations social isolation smoking physical inactivity cancer risk behaviors reported literature socially isolated increases overall mortality risk much or than well established factors obesity lack health care access social isolation associated cancer mortality well least certain demographic groups noted previously discrimination operates across multiple domains including via interpersonal social interactions individuals socially disadvantaged groups may vulnerable discrimination others may resources avoid cope stressors perceived discrimination associated cancer risk behaviors smoking dietary fat intake poor sleep nonreceipt cancer screening discriminatory experiences act psychosocial stressors stimulating physiological responses adversely affecting health status behaviors increase health risks service environment deprivation economic physical social environments may ameliorated adequate community social services however inequitable access services eg rural communities contributes cancer burden associated disparities example transportation allows individuals access employment education healthy food outlets health care resources enhance health unfortunately estimated million americans miss least medical visit year lack transportation higher rates among older female racial ethnic minority groups low levels income education inadequate transportation critical barrier health care disadvantaged communities lack transportation access delay treatment initiation completion diminish quality care impact prognosis particularly survivors requiring specialized care cancer centers public safety another essential service crime violence deleterious impacts health exposure violence adverse experiences eg property crime community violence increase exposure risks disease including cancer study nearly adults found neighborhood safety fears prevalent among socioeconomically disadvantaged individuals compared others inversely associated physical activity nevertheless although physical activity reduce cancer risk provide therapeutic benefits patients cancer eg physical functioning fatigue personal safety inequities inadequately considered physical activity focused

cause i m really close family that s really affected me seeing contact them know ring that together seeing one another hugging grandkids laughs yeah i ve really missed that participants faced challenges navigating transportation system carrying kinship priorities made challenges tolerable and times worth it rowena explained get my daughter s place it s like three buses rang told saturday grandson s making confirmation can t come pick cause she s got much get three boys ready church get husband organised went you re gonna make way there mum i m sorry said that s okay didn t wanna miss it know it s special moment said i ll there don t worry me i ll get there things like don t mind part community participants voiced desire go places part community speaking elder s group simone described main thing does giving central role day to day life looks forward every tuesday said co ordinators make feel loved look them sisters now that s they ve done me mean look much they ve given me they ve given love back strength back able get front door something it s important us group it s incredible value participants place community emphasised reflected impact covid ability maintain social connections rowena explained doctor told go self isolation march last year it s hard can t see anyone so i ve myself so know i d sit talk cat gets sick talking puts sleep wardrobe so was um stressful depressing and know good thoughts feelings isolated long horrible time part community priority participants that times compelled endure challenges associated getting places community first instance although commute hours way via multiple bus train trips volunteer community engagement role rowena remarked i didn t mind loved ringing elders interestingly community appeared value obligation suggested rowena s comment covid hit bit relief cause didn t emphasis added get four hours traveling every day but know since covid everything we ve home so know that s good connecting culture participants out of home activities also represent opportunities connect family heritage culture simone told story coming together brother cousins country visiting grave sites great great great grandparents finally putting together puzzle pieces family history eric discussed participation men s group opportunity spend time uncles make cultural artefacts able go pursue activities negatively affected participants cultural well being referring covid restrictions movement eric noted hard cultural way yeah back country know we re used people around know people weren t allowed come see or whatever like that bad thing sense unease participants felt covid stemmed limitations ability connect culture also concerns safety community individuals keepers stewards aboriginal culture simone explained what s covid done me i m frightened now i m frightened go out fear know lot elders getting there uh cause that s thing that s bothering me too cause we re losing elders it s every one indigenous mob know it s hitting people culture going use transport participants utilised multiple modes transportation access out of home activities including walking for short trips train light rail

experience may not several participants voiced struggle navigate public transport walker gave examples lift walker buses well maneuverer lifts platforms train stations one way participants negotiate rules procedures transport system pertain physical accessibility explained ivan started using walker rang transport new south wales transport new south wales publicly funded state transport agency and asked about uh ramp the thing use wheelchairs said anyone got walking aid even walking stick allowed use ramp go and next bus asking can use ramp mate says no that s wheelchairs said um well transport new south wales said use it no no no no sorry can t use it no no that really got me know would ring transport new south wales again said they re supposed let use it take down driver s number bus number route time ring us back tell us we ll tell bus driver kept going months like every year said why don t tell bus drivers disability people oh can t that complain it know i m thinking ridiculous oh getting really frustrating yeah another set rules procedures standing participants use transport involves need schedule community transport advance participants preferred community transport convenience time travel comes major inconvenience prior travel participants expressed need book community transport advance which understandable service provider perspective compatible reality needing travel spontaneously rowena explained you ve gotta give them like three days notice get transport sometimes you re sick need go day you re sick don t money taxi know makes hard community transport providers best ask problem transport option unable travel community transport short notice means able attend out of home activity commitments transport options resort less desirable option taking bus comes temporal complexity uncertainty see next subsection hassle public transport compared community transport status second choice option community transport emphasised throughout interviews one participant found need book advance challenging public transport seemed easy comparison eric contrasted inconvenience needing book community transport advance ease deciding take public transport moment for community transport it s pretty hard you ve got ring couple days book that part really hard easy part is like said catch train go west side rules procedures broader social care system also impede participants ability travel valued activities destinations asked transport support ndis one participant provided insight process qualifying ndis benefits participant s situation repeatedly turned benefits prompted revealed unsure advocate needs knowing supports services available addressing question transport support ndis eric responded that s laugh couple years ago saying don t register i m going lose benefits that s letter said think i ve still got it that rang up asked forms everything mailed away got email back saying sorry can t put on joke me joke thought well you re kidding aren t you right thing got doctor sort everything out said sorry don t qualify thought well problems got shouldn t problems getting ndis no didn t want me interviewer noted eric able request care plan cultural support terms travel assistance ancestral lands eric remarked oh didn t know that thought it d going bit overboard asking that especially since didn t want anything me one thing would love do it s something i ve never done before it s past years i ve actually known aboriginal side i m wanting know more participant s experience suggests challenges navigating rules procedures broader social care systems hinder one s ability pursue meaningful life activities temporal complexity uncertainty describing experiences public transport participants commented burden places time aside wait bus due infrequent irregular bus schedules participants described need co ordinate multiple bus train times rowena provided example used go office blacktown to volunteer local ngo used catch bus at um morning place to um chester hill station i d get bus stay bus stop seven minutes later another bus came used get parramatta i d get parramatta catch train parramatta blacktown it d take two hours morning sometimes it d take two half hours maybe three coming home public transport associated significant time demands complexity planning also compels participants tolerate level uncertainty time rowena described traveling visit friends family able stay long due need adhere public transport timetables would sometimes need take taxi destination know would leave home taking bus friends like live different suburbs so wanna go visit them sometimes it s like four buses day can t stay long you re trying work timetable so it s really hard catch people get my daughter s place it s like three buses rang told saturday grandson s making confirmation so i m gonna catch taxi go there because know don t know what time i d leave home get church time would catch couple buses temporal complexity uncertainty shaping restricting way participants able live lives fulfil kinship obligations preferences rowena summarised impact lack bus service sundays public holidays succinctly stating that result you re stuck house can t go visit anybody anyway stigma participants provided examples stigma contend engaging out of home activities experience relates to goes far beyond use transportation ada recounted experience relating colour skin started referring dentist appointment went via train get train bus get feeling should not it s one feelings know even planes too doesn t matter go dear get funny feeling that oh belong not reflecting experience stigmatised ada first thought various transport modes used then recalled similar experiences public places it s public transport it s everywhere we ve got stigma shouldn t there could going lunch know feel walk doors um pools go to activities pools stare going to um even shopping could walk apartment unit they d say oh what s doin comin there going into know important places doctor sends ya like hospitals get door corridor boom eyes stare ya must think oh doin here there s nationalities know one place pick us say youse don t belong here they re land aren t they feeling referred led ada question right public continued think are entitled there like think oh get koorie bus people koorie train people like i ve lot of um restaurants and think should eat fast get out white person come along know for them say oh she s him that must okay know condescension participants also discussed treatment received others interacting transportation system experience stigmatised attitude disapproval discrimination directed them here participants describing behaviour others toward them continuing earlier account negotiating bus drivers use ramp ivan described way treated him refusing let ramp someone would say what old ladies are getting on bus can t get up type thing abuse you least one person said me what think are king laughs bus drivers famous eh treating you like you re rubbish condescending treatment ivan received bus drivers directed mobility impairment need walker continued even going shop woman who served treating like uh like little kid like people i ve noticed that lot people treat disability people uh though they ve got physical disability there s also mental disability there way talk you interactions ivan treated service professionals though superior reducing someone like little kid like rubbish participants shared experiences negative treatment others ignored rendered invisible paul s account presence acknowledged personal space encroached upon rowena s account need assistance responded to cause i ve got arthritis that i ve got use lift to access trains sometimes it s hard get

designing restructuring initiative promote aging-in-place, interior health (ih), one six health authorities bc, decided specific social determinants health (sdoh) “need addressed mitigated” specifically named transportation, along housing, food security, limited financial resources, social connectedness (kamloops local action team [lat], , p. ). sdoh social environmental factors negatively impact health cause exacerbate disease. well-known utilized canadian sdoh models include (mikkonen & raphael, ) (health canada, ) determinants, including income (distribution social status), education, housing, employment working conditions, gender, social exclusion/supports, (access to) health services, childhood devel\\xad opment/experiences. neither models include trans\\xad

(hansen et al., ). kamloops lat () include transportation sdoh, recommendations arising health service restructuring plan older adults include solutions mitigate known unknown transportation problems experienced older adults, particularly dwelling rural areas. office seniors advocate, () identified following options bc seniors longer drive: ask family friends, walk, use public transit, take handydart, call taxicab, use volunteer driver programs. handydart free public trans\\xad portation service older adults persons disabilities; clients need register handydart, pre-book trips two business days advance. volunteer driver programs run non-profit or\\xad ganizations like canadian cancer society local seniors’ centers, neighborhood houses, faith communities; programs currently exist bc (office seniors advocate, ). transportation options available throughout province, however. according bc ministry health (bc moh, ), differences types availability transportation options be\\xad tween remote communities (< people), small rural towns ( people), rural towns ( , people), small urban (, ,), urban (, , people), large urban (more , people). example, taxi service rural communities interior bc handydart pick drop elders live “on reserve” (i.e., first nation communities). how\\xad ever, first nation elders residents bc eligible receive medical transportation benefits first nations health authority (fnha, ), covers costs accommodation, meals, mileage. older adults families communities must fill gaps assume additional costs. due limited unaffordable transportation options available, advocacy groups like bc alliance healthy living () call increased transportation options small towns rural communities, noting need expand handydart service include evenings, sundays, holidays; engage health authorities creating ways ensure health care access. older adults must travel urban centers non-emergency medical appointments, also health connections bus runs two days per week rural small rural towns urban centers must booked two business days advance. using service requires lot coordina\\xad tion results long day. rural residents traveling non-medical reasons take bus well; however, subject space thus older adults cannot assured accompaniment travel medical appointments. poses significant barrier older adults experiencing frailty, cognitive sensory impairments, mental health challenges, require assistance traveling and/or attending medical appointments. studies health care restructuring find transportation bar\\xad rier older adults accessing health care services, particularly rural remote communities. case study research atlantic canada found discrepancies rural urban geographies, including fewer services practitioners poor transportation (davenport, rath\\xad well, & rosenberg, ). further, critical ethnography rural aging health disparities southwestern united states stressed restructuring efforts need address transportation solutions older adults isolated communities improved community-based care goal (averill, ). focus groups clients, informal caregivers, health care providers system improvements, lafor\\xad tune, huson, santi,

public transportation recommended policy intervention facilitate aging rural canada (bascu et al., ; see also seniors advocate bc, ). groups older adults adversely affected transportation barriers others, including low income, female, less educated, older minority individuals (syed, gerber, & sharp, ). example, call et al.’s () survey research access health care services found % american indians experienced transportation barriers contrast % nonhispanic white americans. older adults living disabilities included syed et al.’s () list impacted trans\\xad portation barriers, yet likely due biomedicalization aging equating ‘older’ ‘disabled’. transportation challenges easy resolve. survey people communities manitoba (canadian province) examined age-friendliness showed “transportation

rural aging, present service user perspective complex nature transportation pertains health care restructuring initiatives. purpose paper describe trans\\xad portation issues perspective older adults living urban center (uc), two rural towns (rts), seven small rural towns (srts) took part roar (researching older adults’ repositioning) study, sought explore older adults’ views restructuring

participants lived income less $, per year. unsurprisingly, transportation major topic conversation focus groups (fg) interviews (int), regardless community size. study shows complexity transportation relates older adults getting primary community care neighboring community, well receiving home com\\xad munity care health care providers must travel urban center. one participant said, “sometimes isn’t always people need[ing] come health care, health care needs come people” (fg , srt ). specialists urban centers able travel rural towns year around. example, diabetic nurse specialist makes monthly visits, except winter holidays, “…the cardi\\xad ologist comes [hospital nearby rural town], won’t, un\\xad derstandably so, [come up] winter. know, wants risk driving road [in mountains]?” (fg , srt ). inclement weather impacts health care providers, also rural-dwelling older adults needing travel urban centers health care: “i would say [transportation is] one biggest issues i’d say lot us, especially come wintertime, you’re looking travelling nasty roads, pleasant” (int, srt ). participants deal “nasty weather” addition long distances traveling one two small cities (kamloops, kelowna) access er, lab, x-ray, spe\\xad cialists. coordinating visits medical appointments difficult reliant public transportation: “when make appoint\\xad ment specialist kamloops kelowna, haven’t got time think going get there, old people, somehow…they could coordinate appointment buses” (fg, rt ). travel urban centers noted appointments always day, meaning needed pay hotels meals addition finding someone drive them: well, neighbor go kelowna -min procedure cost two nights hotel meals, plus driving back forth [~ miles round trip]. getting someone can’t drive condition, system downloaded lot costs sector least afford – patient (fg, srt ). long distance medical appointments urban centers cost travel raised frequently, one participant suggesting older adults miss appointments save money time: “…there’s three hours travel time go kamloops back again. kelowna, well, even longer…plus price gas. me, okay, suck up, lot people [they might think]: ‘oh goodness! don’t know whether afford run length time’” (int, srt ). opted drive back forth rather paying hotel eligible $ reimbursement travel costs first nations health authority noted cover actual travel costs, particularly driving old (non-fuel-efficient) vehicles. one indigenous elder stated, medical appointments large urban centers (e.g., vancouver) deemed extremely valuable service, eliminate transportation challenges, dialogue indicates: p: one bonuses health connections bus though. it’s five dollar, ten round-trip [cost]. get [small rural town remote location] connect it. p: get picked dropped certain places kam\\xad loops (fg , srt ). solution, study participants suggested “a total health center” “one-stop shopping”, meant co-location health care services: “i think one-stop shopping thing… sort [health care services] bundled one, could go one place … think [this] would take huge load senior care” (fg, rt ). way one “go back forth, there, especially [indigenous] elders [who] don’t enough energy run place” (int, rt ). complexity transportation issues rural-dwelling older adults pertains barriers (financial, environmental, linguistic, cultural) accessing medically necessary health care services urban centers well receiving care home communities health care providers traveling urban centers. box summarizes transportation issues experienced rural-dwelling older adults, hypothetical case presented next provides example transportation issues look like older adult. case rural-dwelling older adult’s access health care services older adult living williams lake, rural town three hours ( miles) northwest kamloops, must ensure medical appointment (s) kamloops booked pm monday health connections bus services williams lake one day. take advantage health connections bus leaves williams lake : every monday, would need book seat thursday previous week book first handydart ride day (at am) ensure arrive health connections bus stop time : am. delays due weather (e.g., snow ice) and/or road conditions (e.g., landslide flooding), health connections bus arrive kamloops : am. older adult approximately three-and-a-half hours kamloops medical appointment(s) errands (e.g., shopping) bus departs pm, arriving williams lake health connections bus stop pm. would take handydart home provided booked two days advance. traveler indigenous elder (with legal “status”) living reserve, would need arrange ride health connections bus stop – unless community serviced handydart – expect reimbursed $ meals (>-h) trip. arduous trip – terms planning duration – one older adults may need repeat weekly could take alone

gas. know, fill truck $. won’t even give half tank won’t even get [name town halfway] back [~ miles] (fg, srt , indigenous elder). resident srt indicated multi-faceted nature trans\\xad portation problems, noting lack taxi service results older adults needing rely neighbors depend handydart drivers: “and don’t taxi…so people totally reliant upon neighbor transportation. handydart exists…it handled bc transit, bus, one bus circulates town, done route, might hour handydart trip terms timing, [the older adult’s] terms [the older adult’s] timing need” (fg , srt ). handydart came frequently, able register book handydart trips stating need schedule trips advance (pick-up drop-off times) yet cannot book appointments walk-in clinics arrive early enough secure appointment. vision test

it’s difficult, difficult get there, even can. i’m speaking people presumably (fg , uc). discussion study carried regionally unique research makes visible multi-faceted nature transportation issues rural-dwelling older adults interior bc, including impacts service users health care providers. transportation consistently identified issue rural older adults studies mentioned previously (averill, ; bascu et al., ; davenport et al., ; grimmer et al., ; hanlon & halseth, ; lafortune et al., ). study adds discus\\xad sion complex nature transportation sdoh ruraldwelling older adults, key consideration restructuring health care services rural areas. study participants, time, participants unable access handy\\xad dart all: “…when needed handydart one day, never [came]. applied two months right last day, hire somebody take [to hospital] cataract. mad” (fg , uc, indigenous elder). health connections bus takes rural-dwelling people living low incomes, identified costs higher required travel urban centers. corresponds findings travel urban centers health care drain financial emotional resources older adults (allan, ball, & alston, ; office seniors advocate, ). even participants urban center (kamloops) faced challenges transportation – e.g., handy\\xad dart able pick people early same-day ap\\xad pointments, resulting people rely taxis – expensive option. access transportation fundamental healthy aging-in-place (chappell, ), recognition sdoh vital ruraldwelling older adults may require ongoing access health care services (hansen et al., ). well-known sdoh models one mikkonen raphael () name transportation geography (rural remote) sdoh. sdoh models appear conducive urban rather rural remote situations one’s housing may located hundreds miles away health care services little access handydart. health care restructuring ih undertaking caters key sdoh, including transportation, still need solutions address complex transportation challenges experienced urbandwelling older adults well rural-dwelling older adults expected travel urban centers access health care services (han\\xad sen et al., ). like previous research shows indigenous people experience increased transportation barriers accessing health care services (call et al., ; ryser & halseth, ), rural- urbandwelling first nation elders study also identified transportation issue. emphasizes need restructuring efforts also address barriers living first nation communities – whether rural urban. policy makers planners consider ways acknowledge compensate people volunteer time drive family mem\\xad bers, friends, neighbors appointments. office seniors advocate, () recommends volunteer drivers eligible receive tax deductions, like use vehicles business. yet, may adequately address issue transportation vehicle acquaintance (family, friend, neighbor) vehicle likely access health care services compared lack access vehicle (syed et al., ). since inequitable distribution health care professionals rural remote regions (wilson et al., ), need reduce rural-dwelling older adults’ repeat visits urban centers. policies need consider single-purpose resources available multi-purpose uses (e.g., using school bus transport older adults needed school pick-up drop-off); health care teams going people rather people coming them. year-round service, sea\\xad sonal one, diabetes need access specialist winter box transportation issues experienced rural-dwelling older adults. (adapted hulko et al., ) • coordinating medical appointments (e.g., specialists urban centers) transportation available certain days week • scheduling handydart medical appointments cannot booked ahead time (e.g., visit walk-in clinic) • getting nearby health connections bus stop time order taken appointments urban centers • experiencing language communication (e.g., sensory impairment) barriers interacting bus drivers • depending others (e.g., friends, neighbors, family members) help meet transportation needs • receiving travel reimbursement less actual costs (e.g., fuel costs old vehicles, cost incurred accompanying friend family member) • dealing difficult driving conditions (e.g., winter) long distances block delay access health care services • receiving less frequent (e.g., monthly) shorter visits health professionals (e.g., diabetes nurse specialist) winter too. notion total health center one-stop shopping mentioned consistent ryser halseth’s () idea “one-stop shops” (p. ) – strategy aims combine travel information financial supports streamline services older adults. munici\\xad palities, health authorities, provincial federal governments need make significant investments transportation infrastructure, programs, personnel assist rural dwelling older adults age place. kamloops already seeing this, newer training campuses need initiated established rural communities health care professional students attracted retained rural remote communities. conclusion analyzing multi-faceted nature transportation, recom\\xad mend restructuring efforts aimed improving community-based care aging-in-place include strategies address transportation infrastructure promote equitable access health care services. study goes beyond recognition “transportation issue” describe – perspective older adult service users – specific challenges administrators, decision-makers practitioners need address support aging-in-place outside urban centers bc’s interior. transportation barriers need addressed immediately system-level solutions begin assessing transportation needs challenges care recipients, linking handydart primary community care services, ensuring greater range health care services available small cities rural towns either physically (e.g., lab) remotely (e.g., telemedicine). covid- pandemic, ih reorient many services remote delivery (e.g., doctor’s visits, physiotherapy, social work). important continue remote delivery pandemic guarantee access rural remote residents, among populations. would prevent older adults make multiple trips medical appointments self-fund either return portion travel costs overnight stay. would also address health inequities diverse groups rural older adults experienced pandemic (hulko & mirza, ). participants included older adults physical dis\\xad abilities used assistive medical devices (canes, walkers, wheelchairs, continuous oxygen therapy), discuss assistive devices relation transportation issues. given trans\\xad portation related systemic issues identified, expect distinct obstacles disabled rural older adults seeking access basic health care. solutions need tailored individual localities rather adopting “cookie-cutter approach” (hulko et al., ). system-wide n.a. mirza w. hulko journal aging studies () solutions critical well. recommendation continue inte\\xad grating transportation health care system health care restructuring initiatives prioritize transportation key sdoh rural-dwelling older adults. acting way could ensure older adults able age place rural remote communities within bc’s interior receive health care affordable equivalent urban peers. research provides evidence encourage policy makers tackle transportation important sdoh health care accessible conducive needs rural communities. embracing rural-dwelling service users, administrators local health authorities ensure rural perspectives given opportunity influence health care decisions, thereby respecting citizenship rights aging place beyond urban core. grimmer, k., kay, d., foot, j., & pastakia, k.
