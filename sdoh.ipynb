    "* The social determinants of health (SDOH) are non-medical factors that can influence public health (WHO). <br>\n",
    "* Factors based on <a href=\"https://www.annualreviews.org/content/journals/10.1146/annurev-publhealth-031210-101218\">The Social Determinants of Health: Coming of Age</a> are: <br>\n",
    "    * <u>Neighbourhood Conditions:</u> social + physical environments; individual health\n",
    "    * <u>Working Conditions:</u> employment-related factors (the physical aspects of working as well as the work environment; psychosocial aspects; opportunities & resources)\n",
    "    * <u>Education:</u> educational opportunities and the social & psychological factors associated\n",
    "    * <u>Income & Wealth:</u> socioeconomic status, the environment one grows up with, and the resources they have access to\n",
    "    * <u>Race & Racism:</u> racial disparities in health & healthcare\n",
    "    * <u>Stress:</u> psychological stressors (their causes & effects)\n",
    "* I have also identified common themes between these classifications, and made note of them, as follows: \n",
    "\n",
    "    * <u>Environment</u>: the physical landscape of the environment, services available, individual health, the physical aspects of work (eg muscle strain, back pain), the work environment (eg collaborative, desk space, etc), area demographics, economic hardship, racial discrimination, relative social status\n",
    "    * <u>Social/Psychological</u>: social relationships, individual health, stress, subjective social status, self-perception\n",
    "    * <u>Opportunities & Resources</u>: literacy, employment opportunities, literacy, income/wealth, education, social safety nets, Medicare, etc.\n",
    "    * <u>Biological Effects</u>: release of cortisol & cytokines, ageing, disease\n",
    "* Socioeconomic factors (SEFs) such as income, education, and employment play a crucial role in shaping transportation accessibility and health outcomes. \n",
    "* From the list above, we are interested in investigating **accessibility and transportation** which falls under the category of **Neighbourhood Conditions** because they are related to the social and physical environment people live in, which affects people's mobility and daily life activities\n",
    "* Accessibility to transportation is also deeply tied with the other themes since socioeconomic status can affect vehicle ownership and access. Lack of transportation can cause psychological stress and increase daily burdens. Having limited transportation also limits access to healthcare, a solid education, and a stable job. All these factors affect people's overall well-being."

    "* **Health:** a person's physical, mental, and emotional well-being in a general sense, not necessarily related to the social determinants of health<br>\n",
    "* **Privilege:** this may be mentioned a lot if SDOH is found to favor some people over others<br>\n",
    "* **Socioeconomic status:** a measurement of where people stand socially or economically; this may be crucial to the social determinants of health<br>\n",
    "* **Transportation:** we are interested in whether an association exists between transportation and the social determinants of health. By looking at positive/negative sentiment of the word along with topics related to privilege and socioeconomic status, we can get a better understanding of how inequalities in accessibility to transportation affect public health.<br>"

bus friends like live different suburbs so wanna go visit them sometimes it s like four bus day can t stay long you re trying work timetable so it s really hard catch people get my daughter s place it

recounted experience relating colour skin started referring dentist appointment went via train get train bus get feeling should not it s one feeling know even plane too doesn t matter go dear get funny feeling that oh belong not reflecting experience stigmatised ada first thought various transport mode ha used then recalled similar experience public places it s public transport it s everywhere we ve got stigma shouldn t there could going lunch know feel walk doors um pools go to activity pools stare going to um even shopping could walk apartment unit they d say oh what s doin comin there going into know important place doctor sends ya like hospitals get door corridor boom eyes stare ya must think oh doin here there s nationality know one place pick us say youse don t belong here they re land aren t they feeling referred ha led ada question right public continued think are entitled there like think oh get koorie bus people koorie train people like i ve lot of um restaurant and
