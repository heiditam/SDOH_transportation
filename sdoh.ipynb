    "* The social determinants of health (SDOH) are non-medical factors that can influence public health (WHO). <br>\n",
    "* Factors based on <a href=\"https://www.annualreviews.org/content/journals/10.1146/annurev-publhealth-031210-101218\">The Social Determinants of Health: Coming of Age</a> are: <br>\n",
    "    * <u>Neighbourhood Conditions:</u> social + physical environments; individual health\n",
    "    * <u>Working Conditions:</u> employment-related factors (the physical aspects of working as well as the work environment; psychosocial aspects; opportunities & resources)\n",
    "    * <u>Education:</u> educational opportunities and the social & psychological factors associated\n",
    "    * <u>Income & Wealth:</u> socioeconomic status, the environment one grows up with, and the resources they have access to\n",
    "    * <u>Race & Racism:</u> racial disparities in health & healthcare\n",
    "    * <u>Stress:</u> psychological stressors (their causes & effects)\n",
    "* I have also identified common themes between these classifications, and made note of them, as follows: \n",
    "\n",
    "    * <u>Environment</u>: the physical landscape of the environment, services available, individual health, the physical aspects of work (eg muscle strain, back pain), the work environment (eg collaborative, desk space, etc), area demographics, economic hardship, racial discrimination, relative social status\n",
    "    * <u>Social/Psychological</u>: social relationships, individual health, stress, subjective social status, self-perception\n",
    "    * <u>Opportunities & Resources</u>: literacy, employment opportunities, literacy, income/wealth, education, social safety nets, Medicare, etc.\n",
    "    * <u>Biological Effects</u>: release of cortisol & cytokines, ageing, disease\n",
    "* Socioeconomic factors (SEFs) such as income, education, and employment play a crucial role in shaping transportation accessibility and health outcomes. \n",
    "* From the list above, we are interested in investigating **accessibility and transportation** which falls under the category of **Neighbourhood Conditions** because they are related to the social and physical environment people live in, which affects people's mobility and daily life activities\n",
    "* Accessibility to transportation is also deeply tied with the other themes since socioeconomic status can affect vehicle ownership and access. Lack of transportation can cause psychological stress and increase daily burdens. Having limited transportation also limits access to healthcare, a solid education, and a stable job. All these factors affect people's overall well-being."

    "* **Health:** a person's physical, mental, and emotional well-being in a general sense, not necessarily related to the social determinants of health<br>\n",
    "* **Privilege:** this may be mentioned a lot if SDOH is found to favor some people over others<br>\n",
    "* **Socioeconomic status:** a measurement of where people stand socially or economically; this may be crucial to the social determinants of health<br>\n",
    "* **Transportation:** we are interested in whether an association exists between transportation and the social determinants of health. By looking at positive/negative sentiment of the word along with topics related to privilege and socioeconomic status, we can get a better understanding of how inequalities in accessibility to transportation affect public health.<br>"

negatively affected participants cultural well being referring covid restrictions movement eric noted hard cultural way yeah back country know we re used people around know people weren t allowed come see or whatever like that bad thing sense unease participants felt covid stemmed limitations ability connect culture also concerns safety community individuals keepers stewards aboriginal culture simone explained what s covid done me i m frightened now i m frightened go out fear know lot elders getting there uh cause that s thing that s bothering me too cause we re losing elders it s every one indigenous mob know it s hitting people culture going use transport participants utilised multiple modes transportation access out of home activities including walking for short trips train light rail bus participants met eligibility criteria qualified assessment also used transport services funded australian government s aged care scheme national disability insurance scheme ndis respectively schemes eligible qualified participants allocated specific amount funded transport services must arrange services themselves destination choosing private service providers include community transport organisations transport community transport buses home care organisations transport personal vehicles driven individual carers provide assistance everyday living participants also used transport organised individual services like local ngo sometimes transport participants location programs services held lastly participants arranged transport informal social arrangements participants get driven family members friends carpool peers going destination using transport participants negotiate several barriers including rules procedures transport system temporal complexity uncertainty stigma condescension rules procedures transport system physical design public transport systems may include accommodations people varying mobility levels service design terms rules norms governing user experience may not several participants voiced struggle navigate public transport walker gave examples lift walker buses well maneuverer lifts platforms train stations one way participants negotiate rules procedures transport system pertain physical accessibility explained ivan started using walker rang transport new south wales transport new south wales publicly funded state transport agency and asked about uh ramp the thing use wheelchairs said anyone got walking aid even walking stick allowed use ramp go and next bus asking can use ramp mate says no that s wheelchairs said um well transport new south wales said use it no no no no sorry can t use it no no that really got me know would ring transport new south wales again said they re supposed let use it take down driver s number bus number route time ring us back tell us we ll tell bus driver kept going months like every year said why don t tell bus drivers disability people oh can t that complain it know i m thinking ridiculous oh getting really frustrating yeah another set rules procedures standing participants use transport involves need schedule community transport advance participants preferred community transport convenience time travel comes major inconvenience prior travel participants expressed need book community transport advance which understandable service provider perspective compatible reality needing travel spontaneously rowena explained you ve gotta give them like three days notice get transport sometimes you re sick need go day you re sick don t money taxi know makes hard community transport providers best ask problem transport option unable travel community transport short notice means able attend out of home activity commitments transport options resort less desirable option taking bus comes temporal complexity uncertainty see next subsection hassle public transport compared community transport status second choice option community transport emphasised throughout interviews one participant found need book advance challenging public transport seemed easy comparison eric contrasted inconvenience needing book community transport advance ease deciding take public transport moment for community transport it s pretty hard you ve got ring couple days book that part really hard easy part is like said catch train go west side rules procedures broader social care system also impede participants ability travel valued activities destinations asked transport support ndis one participant provided insight process qualifying ndis benefits participant s situation repeatedly turned benefits prompted revealed unsure advocate needs knowing supports services available addressing question transport support ndis eric responded that s laugh couple years ago saying don t register i m going lose benefits that s letter said think i ve still got it that rang up asked forms everything mailed away got email back saying sorry can t put on joke me joke thought well you re kidding aren t you right thing got doctor sort everything out said sorry don t qualify thought well problems got shouldn t problems getting ndis no didn t want me interviewer noted eric able request care plan cultural support terms travel assistance ancestral lands eric remarked oh didn t know that thought it d going bit overboard asking that especially since didn t want anything me one thing would love do it s something i ve never done before it s past years i ve actually known aboriginal side i m wanting know more participant s experience suggests challenges navigating rules procedures broader social care systems hinder one s ability pursue meaningful life activities temporal complexity uncertainty describing experiences public transport participants commented burden places time aside wait bus due infrequent irregular bus schedules participants described need co ordinate multiple bus train times rowena provided example used go office blacktown to volunteer local ngo used catch bus at um morning place to um chester hill station i d get bus stay bus stop seven minutes later another bus came used get parramatta i d get parramatta catch train parramatta blacktown it d take two hours morning sometimes it d take two half hours maybe three coming home public transport associated significant time demands complexity planning also compels participants tolerate level uncertainty time rowena described traveling visit friends family able stay long due need adhere public transport timetables would sometimes need take taxi destination know would leave home taking bus friends like live different suburbs so wanna go visit them sometimes it s like four buses day can t stay long you re trying work timetable so it s really hard catch people get my daughter s place it s like three buses rang told saturday grandson s making confirmation so i m gonna catch taxi go there because know don t know what time i d leave home get church time would catch couple buses temporal complexity uncertainty shaping restricting way participants able live lives fulfil kinship obligations preferences rowena summarised impact lack bus service sundays public holidays succinctly stating that result you re stuck house can t go visit anybody anyway stigma participants provided examples stigma contend engaging out of home activities experience relates to goes far beyond use transportation ada recounted experience relating colour skin started referring dentist appointment went via train get train bus get feeling should not it s one feelings know even planes too doesn t matter go dear get funny feeling that oh belong not reflecting experience stigmatised ada first thought various transport modes used then recalled similar experiences public places it s public transport it s everywhere we ve got stigma shouldn t there could going lunch know feel walk doors um pools go to activities pools stare going to um even shopping could walk apartment unit they d say oh what s doin comin there going into know important places doctor sends ya like hospitals get door corridor boom eyes stare ya must think oh doin here there s nationalities know one place pick us say youse don t belong here they re land aren t they feeling referred led ada question right public continued think are entitled there like think oh get koorie bus people koorie train people like i ve lot of um restaurants and think should eat fast get out white person come along know for them say oh she s him that must okay know condescension participants also discussed treatment received others interacting transportation system experience stigmatised attitude disapproval discrimination directed them here participants describing behaviour others toward them continuing earlier account negotiating bus drivers use ramp ivan described way treated him refusing let ramp someone would say what old ladies are getting on bus can t get up type thing abuse you least one person said me what think are king laughs bus drivers famous eh treating you like you re rubbish condescending treatment ivan received bus drivers directed mobility impairment need walker continued even going shop woman who served treating like uh like little kid like people i ve noticed that lot people treat disability people uh though they ve got physical disability there s also mental disability there way talk you interactions ivan treated service professionals though superior reducing someone like little kid like rubbish participants shared experiences negative treatment others ignored rendered invisible paul s account presence acknowledged personal space encroached upon rowena s account need assistance responded to cause i ve got arthritis that i ve got use lift to access trains sometimes it s hard get

complexity transportation, acts barrier appropriate timely access healthcare services older adults rural com\\xad munities. article presents findings qualitative research study explored complex nature transportation challenges rural-dwelling older adults experience western canada trying access primary community care services. data derived larger study service user views healthcare restructuring initiative intended facilitate aging-in-place. conducted focus groups interviews diverse sample older adults living one urban centre nine rural small rural towns british columbia (bc)’s interior. used content analysis determine codes derive themes. study findings showed transportation top priority improving primary community care. older adult participants identified range transportation challenges trying get healthcare services care providers getting them. transportation social determinant health (sdoh) participants, regardless whether lived urban centre rural small rural town. study provides evidence support transportation key sdoh rural-dwelling older adults. such, transportation specifically addressed healthcare restructuring initiatives aim support aging-in-place. service providers need advocate system-wide solutions integrating transportation healthcare system, imperative decision-makers act solutions. introduction older adults living rural semi urban areas increase age, mobility often decreases (mattson, ). one key component mobility transportation (webber, porter, & menec, ). reliable transportation provides access needed healthcare services, helps maintain social connections, vital communities considered healthy. people limited access transportation may experience delayed medical appointments, poor health outcomes, increased utilization health care services – increase healthcare costs (health research & educational trust, ). however, restructuring healthcare services always take consideration transportation social determinant health (sdoh) complex role plays impacting health outcomes older adults, particularly live rural remote regions. paper reports multifaceted nature transportation social determinant health drawing perspective older adults living interior british columbia (bc), canada. paper un\\xad earths lack transportation options, particularly bc’s rural re\\xad gions, discusses negative impact older adults’ ability age place. background designing restructuring initiative promote aging-in-place, interior health (ih), one six health authorities bc, decided specific social determinants health (sdoh) “need addressed mitigated” specifically named transportation, along housing, food security, limited financial resources, social connectedness (kamloops local action team [lat], , p. ). sdoh social environmental factors negatively impact health cause exacerbate disease. well-known utilized canadian sdoh models include (mikkonen & raphael, ) (health canada, ) determinants, including income (distribution social status), education, housing, employment working conditions, gender, social exclusion/supports, (access to) health services, childhood devel\\xad opment/experiences. neither models include trans\\xad portation, crucial role transportation older adults’ access health care services widely understood social gerontologists geographers (chappell, ), addressed within context rural transportation options (hansen et al., ). kamloops lat () include transportation sdoh, recommendations arising health service restructuring plan older adults include solutions mitigate known unknown transportation problems experienced older adults, particularly dwelling rural areas. office seniors advocate, () identified following options bc seniors longer drive: ask family friends, walk, use public transit, take handydart, call taxicab, use volunteer driver programs. handydart free public trans\\xad portation service older adults persons disabilities; clients need register handydart, pre-book trips two business days advance. volunteer driver programs run non-profit or\\xad ganizations like canadian cancer society local seniors’ centers, neighborhood houses, faith communities; programs currently

be\\xad tween remote communities (< people), small rural towns ( people), rural towns ( , people), small urban (, ,), urban (, , people), large urban (more , people). example, taxi service rural communities interior bc handydart pick drop elders live “on reserve” (i.e., first nation communities). how\\xad ever, first nation elders residents bc eligible receive medical transportation benefits first nations health authority (fnha, ), covers costs accommodation, meals, mileage. older adults families communities must fill gaps assume additional costs. due limited unaffordable transportation options available, advocacy groups like bc alliance healthy living () call increased transportation options small towns rural communities, noting need expand handydart service include evenings, sundays, holidays; engage health authorities creating ways ensure health care access. older adults must travel urban centers non-emergency medical appointments, also health connections bus runs two days per week rural small rural towns urban centers must booked two business days advance. using service requires lot coordina\\xad tion results long day. rural residents traveling non-medical reasons take bus well; however, subject space thus older adults cannot assured accompaniment travel medical appointments. poses significant barrier older adults experiencing frailty, cognitive sensory impairments, mental health challenges, require assistance traveling and/or attending medical appointments. studies health care restructuring find transportation bar\\xad rier older adults accessing health care services, particularly rural remote communities. case study research atlantic canada found discrepancies rural urban geographies, including fewer services practitioners poor transportation (davenport, rath\\xad well, & rosenberg, ). further, critical ethnography rural aging health disparities southwestern united states stressed restructuring efforts need address transportation solutions older adults isolated communities improved community-based care goal (averill, ). focus groups clients, informal caregivers, health care providers system improvements, lafor\\xad tune, huson, santi, stolee () identified transportation barrier, rural participants. similarly, study identify imminent changes health care providers northern bc (hanlon & halseth, ) found lack services older adults recom\\xad mended housing transportation examined older adults rural communities. key element aging-in-place determined australian study community-dwelling older adults transport (grimmer, kay, foot, & pastakia, ). another study found inadequate transportation barrier social support older chinese malay adults living alone rural areas malaysia (evans, allotey, imelda, reidpath, & pool, ). likewise, public transportation recommended policy intervention facilitate aging rural canada (bascu et al., ; see also seniors advocate bc, ). groups older adults adversely affected transportation barriers others, including low income, female, less educated, older minority individuals (syed, gerber, & sharp, ). example, call et al.’s () survey research access health care services found % american indians experienced transportation barriers contrast % nonhispanic white americans. older adults living disabilities included syed et al.’s () list impacted trans\\xad portation barriers, yet likely due biomedicalization aging equating ‘older’ ‘disabled’. transportation challenges easy resolve. survey people communities manitoba (canadian province) examined age-friendliness showed “transportation options” one community characteristics age-friendliness difficult improve due inability rural communities provide transport services (menec et al., ). respond studies exploring regional transportation needs older adults, northern bc study ryser halseth () drew upon several qualitative studies involving key informants conclude mobility constraints hinder rural seniors’ access regionalized care health services. also highlighted need senior-appropriate transport services connect first nation reserves. studies stress need health care administrators policy makers act transportation improve rural aging, present service user perspective complex nature transportation pertains health care restructuring initiatives. purpose paper describe trans\\xad portation issues perspective older adults living urban center (uc), two rural towns (rts), seven small rural towns (srts) took part roar (researching older adults’ repositioning) study, sought explore older adults’ views restructuring

process, discovered transportation far complex issue anticipated. summarized transportation issues publication, article includes full results situates findings transportation sdoh within context transportation options currently available older adults bc, impact rural older adults’ access health care services. findings community-dwelling older adults ( women, men) participated roar study consisted residents kamloops (.%) well rural towns (.%). average age years (range: ), % complex chronic disease (i.e., two chronic conditions), % identified indigenous, % south asian. half (%) participants lived income less $, per year. unsurprisingly, transportation major topic conversation focus groups (fg) interviews (int), regardless community size. study shows complexity transportation relates older adults getting primary community care neighboring community, well receiving home com\\xad munity care health care providers must travel urban center. one participant said, “sometimes isn’t always people need[ing] come health care, health care needs come people” (fg , srt ). specialists urban centers able travel rural towns year around. example, diabetic nurse specialist makes monthly visits, except winter holidays, “…the cardi\\xad ologist comes [hospital nearby rural town], won’t, un\\xad derstandably so, [come up] winter. know, wants risk driving road [in mountains]?” (fg , srt ). inclement weather impacts health care providers, also rural-dwelling older adults needing travel urban centers health care: “i would say [transportation is] one biggest issues i’d say lot us, especially come wintertime, you’re looking travelling nasty roads, pleasant” (int, srt ). participants deal “nasty weather” addition long distances traveling one two small cities (kamloops, kelowna) access er, lab, x-ray, spe\\xad cialists. coordinating visits medical appointments difficult reliant public transportation: “when make appoint\\xad ment specialist kamloops kelowna, haven’t got time think going get there, old people, somehow…they could coordinate appointment buses” (fg, rt ). travel urban centers noted appointments always day, meaning needed pay hotels meals addition finding someone drive them: well, neighbor go kelowna -min procedure cost two nights hotel meals, plus driving back forth [~ miles round trip]. getting someone can’t drive condition, system downloaded lot costs sector least afford – patient (fg, srt ). long distance medical appointments urban centers cost travel raised frequently, one participant suggesting older adults miss appointments save money time: “…there’s three hours travel time go kamloops back again. kelowna, well, even longer…plus price gas. me, okay, suck up, lot people [they might think]: ‘oh goodness! don’t know whether afford run length time’” (int, srt ). opted drive back forth rather paying hotel eligible $ reimbursement travel costs first nations health authority noted cover actual travel costs, particularly driving old (non-fuel-efficient) vehicles. one indigenous elder stated, medical appointments large urban centers (e.g., vancouver) deemed extremely valuable service, eliminate transportation challenges, dialogue indicates: p: one bonuses health connections bus though. it’s five dollar, ten round-trip [cost]. get [small rural town remote location] connect it. p: get picked dropped certain places kam\\xad loops (fg , srt ). solution, study participants suggested “a total health center” “one-stop shopping”, meant co-location health care services: “i think one-stop shopping thing… sort [health care services] bundled one, could go one place … think [this] would take huge load senior care” (fg, rt ). way one “go back forth, there, especially [indigenous] elders [who] don’t enough energy run place” (int, rt ). complexity transportation issues rural-dwelling older adults pertains barriers (financial, environmental, linguistic, cultural) accessing medically necessary health care services urban centers well receiving care home communities health care providers traveling urban centers. box summarizes transportation issues experienced rural-dwelling older adults, hypothetical case presented next provides example transportation issues look like older adult. case rural-dwelling older adult’s access health care services older adult living williams lake, rural town three hours ( miles) northwest kamloops, must ensure medical appointment (s) kamloops booked pm monday health connections bus services williams lake one day. take advantage health connections bus leaves williams lake : every monday, would

rural-dwelling older adults. (adapted hulko et al., ) • coordinating medical appointments (e.g., specialists urban centers) transportation available certain days week • scheduling handydart medical appointments cannot booked ahead time (e.g., visit walk-in clinic) • getting nearby health connections bus stop time order taken appointments urban centers • experiencing language communication (e.g., sensory impairment) barriers interacting bus drivers • depending others (e.g., friends, neighbors, family members) help meet transportation needs • receiving travel reimbursement less actual costs (e.g., fuel costs old vehicles, cost incurred accompanying friend family member) • dealing difficult driving conditions (e.g., winter) long distances block delay access health care services • receiving less frequent (e.g., monthly) shorter visits health professionals (e.g., diabetes nurse specialist) winter living low incomes, identified costs higher required travel urban centers. corresponds findings travel urban centers health care drain financial emotional resources older adults (allan, ball, & alston, ; office seniors advocate, ). even participants urban center (kamloops) faced challenges transportation – e.g., handy\\xad dart able pick people early same-day ap\\xad pointments, resulting people rely taxis – expensive option. access transportation fundamental healthy aging-in-place (chappell, ), recognition sdoh vital ruraldwelling older adults may require ongoing access health care services (hansen et al., ). well-known sdoh models one mikkonen raphael () name transportation geography (rural remote) sdoh. sdoh models appear conducive urban rather rural remote situations one’s housing may located hundreds miles away health care services little access handydart. health care restructuring ih undertaking caters key sdoh, including transportation, still need solutions address complex transportation challenges experienced urbandwelling older adults well rural-dwelling older adults expected travel urban centers access health care services (han\\xad sen et al., ). like previous research shows indigenous people experience increased transportation barriers accessing health care services (call et al., ;
